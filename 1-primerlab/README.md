### 98-008: Intro to the Rust Programming Language
# Primer Lab

The goal of this homework is to make sure that you understand Rust's basic syntax.

We recommend you make use of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html), chapters 1-3, as a "textbook" of this course. It's generally easy to follow along with, and would make handy reference material for the labs in this course.

We expect you to spend less than an hour on this homework, so if you are spending more than that, please let us know! This time limit does not include setting up Rust on your machine though, so if you have trouble with installing Rust, make sure to ask for help.

## Setup

Make sure you have Rust installed. You should have installed Rust through `rustup`. To confirm, run:
```sh
$ rustup --version
$ cargo --version
```
Make sure both of those commands execute successfully.

## Part 1: Exercises

In this part, you will look at 8 files that do not compile, and modify them each in some way to make them compile. 

Run this command in the root of your project (parent directory of the `src/` folder):
```sh
$ cargo test -- fixme
```
**What does the error say?** Go into `src/exercises/fixme1.rs` and make the change.

When you are able to run `cargo test -- fixme` without any errors, move on to the next exercise by uncommenting `mod fixme2` in `src/exercises/mod.rs`. Go through all 8 of the exercises and make sure that the 8 test cases pass when you run `cargo test -- fixme`.


## Part 2: Function implementations

For this part, you will need to implement 4 simple functions in Rust.
In `src/lib.rs`, you will find 4 functions with a `todo!()` inside of them. Replace that `todo!()` with your implementation, according to the comment specification. Two of the four functions require you to implement them a certain way, so make sure to read those comments carefully.

To test all of your functions, run:
```sh
$ cargo test
```
If you find that a test is running slowly, try running `cargo test --release`, whcih runs the tests in release mode. We'll talk about this more in future weeks, but basically it runs the tests with more compiler optimizations (like the `-O2` flag). Also, if you want to run a specific test, run `cargo test -- it_works` with the name of the test instead of `it_works`.

Finally, go into `main.rs` and replace the `todo!()` with something that will tell the user if their input is a prime number or not (this is not a trick question). You can run this program by running:
```sh
$ cargo run
```

## Submission 
- Run `make handin`
- Submit the resultant `handin.tar` to Gradescope.

If you do not have `make` and `tar` installed on your system, install `make` and `tar` on your machine or use the CMU Linux SSH machines. If you need help with this, please reach out to us!

## Collaboration
In general, feel free to discuss homeworks with other students! As long as you do not copy someone else's work, any communication is fair game. Feel free to discuss on the course Discord so that other students can see your questions and answers, as well.


## Feedback
We would also like to reiterate that you should let us know if you spent anywhere in significant excess of an hour on this homework. These assignments are being deployed for the first time, and we are definitely open to feedback regarding the length and difficulty. In addition, Rust has a notoriously steep learning curve, so if you find yourself not understanding the concepts, you should reach out to us and let us know as well---chances are, you're not the only one!
