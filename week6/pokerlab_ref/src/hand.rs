//! Module for poker hand evaluation and comparison.
//!
//! There is a bit of Poker lingo that this file uses. If you find yourself confused by anything,
//! please reach out to us and ask! The term that will probably be most confusing is a "kicker".
//! A "kicker", also known as a "side card", is simply a card that does not take part in determine
//! the rank of a hand. For example, if we want to compare 2 four-of-a-kinds, the fifth card in each
//! hand would be considered the kicker. Note that kickers are still important in breaking ties.
//!
//! A good way to approach this assignment is to first read the code in `src/card.rs`, and then
//! read all of the starter code in this file (`src/hand.rs`). If you are unfamiliar with Poker, you
//! may also want to read up on the hands you can make on [Wikipedia]. Finally (as a good rule of
//! thumb for any programming course), make sure to go over the test cases to make sure you have a
//! correct idea of what you should implement.
//!
//! You are also allowed to change _any_ of the private fields of structs in this file, as long as
//! you are able to implement the all of the [`Hand`] methods without issue. You are also allowed to
//! modify the [`PokerHand::solve`] method, but be aware that the test cases are _solely_ using that
//! method to check the correctness of your implementation, so make sure not to play around with it
//! too much.
