// Would you have preferred this to be in src/hofs.rs or src/hofs/mod.rs?

//! This module contains some functions that require higher-order functions to implement them.
//!
//! Implement this module _after_ the [`iterators`](self) module.
//!
//! We recommend implementing [`sum_squares`] _before_ [`fib_fun`], since [`sum_squares`] is really
//! just a warmup exercise.
//!
//! See the function documentation within these modules for more information.

/// A quick exercise to get familiar with using iterators and higher-order functions.
/// Do this **first**.
pub mod sum_squares;

/// A lot of documentation, if you choose to read it.
/// Do this **second**, and only if you have time to spare.
pub mod fib_fun;
