//! This module contains the [`EmailReader`] type, as well as its method implementations.
//!
//! The [`EmailReader`] struct will model an email message.
//! [`EmailReader`] should have the following attributes:
//!  - `subject: String`
//!  - `from: String`
//!  - `to: String`
//!  - `message: String`
//!
//! All of these fields should be _private_ (not accessible outside of the struct).
//!
//! ---
//!
//! Once you've added the fields to the struct, implement the following methods:
//! - [`parse`](EmailReader::parse): This method will take in a file path and
//! create a new [`EmailReader`] based on the file.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! We also want [`EmailReader`]s to be able to summarize themselves.
//! We'll want to implement the following methods
//! [`msg_len`](Summary::msg_len), [`summarize`](Summary::summarize),
//! and [`get_info`](Summary::get_info),
//!
//! - [`msg_len`](Summary::msg_len) should return the length of the message.
//! - [`summarize`](Summary::summarize) should return a string that contains `"<sender>: message"`.
//! - [`get_info`](Summary::get_info) should return a string that contains
//! `"{subject}\nFrom: {sender}, To: {receiver}"`.
//!
//! Since we'll probably need to do this again ðŸ˜‰, instead of implementing all three methods
//! in the main `impl` block, we'll instead implement the trait [`Summary`]
//! that already has these 3 methods defined for us!
