### 98-008: Intro to the Rust Programming Language

# Primer Lab

The goal of this homework is to make sure that you understand Rust's basic syntax.

There is a markdown-rendered version of this writeup on our website that we would recommend using.
It is automatically generated using Rust's documentation tooling, and is very similar to Rust
documentation that you will find in the wild!

We recommend you make use of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) chapters 1-3 for this
homework, as we consider the book the "textbook" of this course. It's generally easy to follow along
with, and would make handy reference material for the homeworks in this course.

We've tried to calibrate this homework to take around an hour, so if you are spending much more than
that, please let us know! This time bound does _not_ include setting up Rust on your machine, so if
you have trouble with installing Rust, make sure to ask for help!

# Setup

Make sure you have Rust installed. You should have installed Rust through `rustup`. To confirm, run:

```sh
$ rustup --version
rustup 1.27.1 (54dd3d00f 2024-04-24)
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.83.0 (5ffbef321 2024-10-29)
```

Make sure that both of those commands execute successfully, and that they have relatively recent
dates. If the dates are not recent, you can update `rustup` by running `rustup update`.

If you want a local version of this generated writeup, you can generate it with `cargo doc`. Once
you have `cargo` installed, run `cargo doc --open` in this directory to generate documentation for
this homework.

```sh
$ cargo doc --open
Documenting primerlab v0.1.0 (<path>/primerlab)
   Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.11s
    Opening <path>/primerlab/target/doc/primerlab/index.html
```

Either way, a version of this writeup will be up on our website!

# Part 1: Exercises

For the first part of this homework, there are 8 files that do not compile under `src/exercises`.
You will need to modify each of them in some way to make them compile.

Run this command in the root of your project (parent directory of the `src/` folder):

```sh
$ cargo test
```

**What does the error say?** Go into `src/exercises/fixme1.rs` and make the change.

When you are able to run `cargo test` without any errors,
move on to the next exercise by uncommenting `pub mod fixme2` in `src/exercises/mod.rs`.
Go through all 8 of the exercises by uncommenting each of the `pub mod fixme_;`s,
and make sure that all the `fixme_` test cases pass when you run `cargo test`.

At this point, you'll see some other tests failing. You'll fix those in the next section!

# Part 2: Function implementations

You will now need to implement 4 relatively simple functions in Rust.
In `src/functions.rs`, you will find 4 functions with a `todo!()` inside of them.
Replace that `todo!()` with your implementation, according to the comment specification.

_One of the functions requires you to implement it in a certain way,_
_so make sure to read those comments carefully._

To test all of your functions, run:

```sh
$ cargo test
```

Note that `cargo test` will run the tests under `src/tests.rs`, as well as run each of the
code examples in the comments.

If you find that a test is running slowly, run `cargo test --release`,
which runs the tests in release mode. This runs the tests with
compiler optimizations (like the `-O2` flag for C) and without debug symbols.

Also, if you want to run a specific test like `fn it_works()`, run `cargo test -- it_works`
with the name of the test instead of `it_works`.

If you find yourself struggling, make sure to read the comments! They contain useful hints...

# Submission

### Formatting and Style

The autograder will run these two commands on your code:

```sh
cargo clippy && cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

**If the autograder detects any errors from the command above, you will not be able to receive**
**any points.** This may seem strict, but we have decided to follow standard best practices for
Rust.

By following [Rust's style guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/style-guide/), you ensure
that anybody reading your code (who is familiar with Rust) will be able to easily navigate your
code. This can help with diving into an unfamiliar code base, and it also eliminates the need for
debate with others over style rules, saving time and energy.

See the official [guidelines](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/style-guide/) for more information.

### Unix

If you are on a unix system, we will try to create a `handin.zip` automatically for you,
**but you will need to have `zip` already installed**.

If you _do not_ have `zip` installed on your system, install `zip` on your machine or use the CMU
Linux SSH machines. If you need help with this, please reach out to us!

Once you have `zip` installed, we will create the `handin.zip` automatically for you (_take a peek_
_into `build.rs` file if you're interested in how this works!_).

Once you have the `handin.zip` file, submit it (and only the zip) to Gradescope.

### Windows

If you are on a windows system, you can zip the `src/` folder manually and upload that to
Gradescope.

Note that you don't _need_ to name it `handin.zip`, you can name it whatever you'd like.

# Collaboration

In general, feel free to discuss homeworks with other students! As long as you do not copy someone
else's work, any communication is fair game.

All formal questions should be asked on Piazza. Try to discuss on Piazza so that other students can
see your questions and answers as well!

You can also discuss on Discord, but try to keep any technical questions on Piazza.

# Feedback

We would like to reiterate that you should let us know if you spent anywhere in significant excess
of an hour on this homework.

In addition, Rust has a notoriously steep learning curve, so if you find yourself not understanding
the concepts, you should reach out to us and let us know as well --- chances are, you're not the
only one!
