/*
 * In this module, we'll be implementing the Charmander struct.
 * The Charmander struct will model the pokemon of the same name.
 * We want to design the struct such that it is easy to create a new fire type pokemon.
 * As well as modify the pokemon's attributes such as its health, level, and name.
 *
 * Charmander has the following attributes:
 *  - name: String
 *  - level: usize
 *  - health: usize
 *  - attack: usize
 *  - defense: usize
 *
 * Once you've designed the struct, implement the following methods:
 * - new: This method will take in a name and create a new Charmander struct with the following default values:
 *   - level: 1
 *   - health: 100
 *   - attack: 42
 *   - defense: 33
 *
 * - level_up: This method will increase the level of the Charmander struct by argument l.
 * - get_attack: This method will return the attack value of the Charmander struct.
 *  - The attack value is calculated by the following formula: (attack + (10*level))
 * - get_defense: This method will return the defense value of the Charmander struct.
 *  - The defense value is calculated by the following formula: (defense + (15*level))
 * - get_health: This method will return the health value of the Charmander struct.
 *  - The health value does not change as the Charmander levels up.
 *
 *
 * We also want Charmanders to battle with each other.
 * We'll design the following functions:
 *  - attack: This function will take in two mutable references to Charmander structs.
 *      - The first argument will be the attacking Charmander.
 *      - The second argument will be the defending Charmander.
 *      - The attacking Charmander will deal damage to the defending Charmander has a lower level.
 *      - The damage dealt is based on the attacking Charmander's attack value and the defending Charmander's defense value.
 *      - The defending Charmander's health will be reduced by the damage dealt (or put to 0 if too large)
