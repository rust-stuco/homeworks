#![allow(clippy::new_without_default)]

//! This module contains the [`Eevee`] and [`EvolvedEevee`] type, as well as its
//! method implementations.
//!
//! In this module, we'll be implementing a variable-type pokemon that represents
//! some of the Eevee evolution line:
//!  - Eevee
//!      - Vaporeon
//!      - Flareon
//!      - Leafeon
//!
//! To model the evolution line, we use a type system that represents the possible
//! states that the Eevee can be in.
//!
//! We have an [`Eevee`] type that contains stats about the
//! Eevee, and several methods that can retrieve and modify these stats. We also have an
//! [`EvolvedEevee`] type that can be one of Vaporeon, Flareon, and Leafeon.
//!
//! An [`Eevee`] can [`evolve`](Eevee::evolve) into an [`EvolvedEevee`],
//! and an [`EvolvedEevee`] can [`devolve`](EvolvedEevee::devolve)
//! back into an [`Eevee`].
//!
//! You will need to implement all 3 of the methods on [`Eevee`]:
//! [`new`](Eevee::new), [`take_damage`](Eevee::take_damage), and [`evolve`](Eevee::evolve).
//!
//! You will also need to implement 2 more methods on [`EvolvedEevee`]:
//! [`take_damage`](EvolvedEevee::take_damage) and [`devolve`](EvolvedEevee::devolve).
//! The remaining methods on [`EvolvedEevee`] have been implemented for you.
//!
//! See the documentation below for each of these types to learn more!

/// This type represents a basic [`Eevee`] pokemon. It has a level, as well as health,
/// attack, and defense stats.

/// You will need to implement all 3 of the methods on [`Eevee`]:

/// _Something to note is that while it is possible to implement getters and setters for struct_
/// _fields as if they were objects in OOP-paradigm languages, it is generally unnecessary for Rust._
/// _It can even get you into trouble with the borrow checker when dealing_
/// _with fields that are references (we may talk about this when we get to _lifetimes_ in week 7)._
///
/// _Marking a field as `pub`, coupled with the borrow checker, will give you very similar_
/// _semantics as to normal getters and setters._
///
/// _There are, of course, places where you _do_ want these._
/// _And when we talk about traits in week 5,_
/// _we will **need** to have them if we want to share behavior among types._
