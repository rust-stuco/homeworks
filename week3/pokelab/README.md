### 98-008: Intro to the Rust Programming Language



# Poke Lab

The goal of this homework is to make sure that you understand Rust's Structs and Enums,
semantically known as Algebraic Data Types.

In this homework, you will be implementing two data types:
[`Charmander`](pokemon::charmander) and [`Eevee`](pokemon::eevee).

This will be the first homework where you have to start writing code,
so this may take a little longer than the last homework.
If you are spending _significantly_ more than 1 hour on this, please let us know!

For this homework, you should use the markdown-generated writeup. You can either get it from
our website, or generate it directly on your computer with `cargo doc --open`.
Having this form of documentation allows you to follow hyperlinks
to get to documentation on specific types and methods.

# Submission

We will try to create a `handin.tar` automatically for you,
**but you will need to have `tar` already installed**.

If you _do not_ have `tar` installed on your system,
install `tar` on your machine or use the CMU Linux SSH machines.
If you need help with this, please reach out to us!

Once you have `tar` installed, we will create the `handin.tar` automatically for you
(_take a peek into `build.rs` if you're interested in how this works!_).

Once you have the `handin.tar`, submit it to Gradescope.



# Collaboration

In general, feel free to discuss homeworks with other students!
As long as you do not copy someone else's work, any communication is fair game.

Try to discuss on the course Discord or Piazza so that
other students can see your questions and answers as well!

Remember that all formal questions should be asked on Piazza.



# Feedback

We would like to reiterate that you should let us know if you spent
anywhere in significant excess of an hour on this homework.

In addition, Rust has a notoriously steep learning curve,
so if you find yourself not understanding the concepts,
you should reach out to us and let us know as well ---
chances are, you're not the only one!
